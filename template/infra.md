# Azure Infrastructure

**Responsibilities:**
- Provision required infrastructure and toolset for deployment.

**Suggested Approach:**
- Use **Azure Static Web App** for the Frontend.
- Use **Azure App Service** for the Backend.
- Set up a **GitHub Action** to deploy both infrastructure and software.
- **Note:** OpenAI provisioning will be handled manually by Team A.
